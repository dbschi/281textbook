\begin{notation}
    Here we will sometimes drop the arrow to denote vectors and coordinates in $\reals^n$.
    Moreover, consistent with our vector notation, if the output of a function $f$ is a vector in $\reals^n$, then we will denote $f_1,\ldots, f_n$ as the corresponding entries (as functions) of the output.
\end{notation}

We now relax the conditions that functions have to be linear. Moreover, we can restrict the domain of the function to be some subset $\Omega \subseteq \reals^n$, as some functions are not everywhere defined on $\reals^m$.

\example{
    Find the largest domain $\Omega\subseteq\reals^3$ such that the function \[
        f(x,y,z)=\frac{1}{x^2+y^2+z^2-9}   
    \]
    is defined.
}
The right hand side is well defined for any $x^2+y^2+z^2-9\neq 0$. That is, you can calculate the right hand side as long as you are not dividing by zero. This means we can take the largest domain to be $\Omega = \reals^3 - \{(x,y,z)|x^2+y^2+z^3=9\}$. What is this mysterious region described by $x^2+y^2+z^2=9$? Recall that $\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$ is distance of $(x,y,z)$ from the origin, so this traces out a sphere of radius $3$.

\section{Graphing in $\reals^n$}

Graphing has always been a useful tool for to gain intuition about the `shape' of functions. Here we formalize the definition of the graph of a function.

\definition{Graph}{
    \domain{f}{n}{}. We denote the \textbf{Graph} of $f$ to be $\Gamma_f$, and is the subset of $\reals^{n+1}$ \[
    \Gamma_f\defeq\{(\vec{x},f(\vec{x})) \ |\ \vec{x}\in\Omega\}.
    \]
}
Intuitively, this means we take $\Omega$ and lift that set in the $(n+1)$-st dimension according to the value of $f(\vec{x})$ evaluated at each point.
\example{
    Let $f(x,y)=(49+3x-2y)/6$, then the graph of $f$ is a plane in 3D space, which we have sketched in \hyperref[ex:1.26]{one example} in the first chapter.
}

This is not too hard to understand for one or two variables, but gets out of hand quickly as $n$ increases. I sometimes struggle to visualize even in the third dimension. One way to get around this is to look at the cross sections of a graph. 
\definition{Level set}{
    \domain{f}{n}{}. Let $c\in \reals$. The \textbf{level set} of $f$ at $c$ is denoted $L_c$, and is the set \[
    L_c\defeq \{\vec{x}\in\Omega \ | \ f(\vec{x})=c\}.
    \]
}
Why is this a natural definition? Consider the the intersection between $\Gamma_f$ and the hyperplane described by the set of $(\vec{x},c)$ for all $\vec{x}\in \reals^n$. This plane will intersect all the points in $L_c$, except they are lifted in the $(n+1)$-st dimension by $c$ units. That is, if you understand how all the $L_c$'s behave for all values of $c$, you understand how the graph of $L_c$ behaves.

\example{
    What are the level sets of the function $f(x,y)=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$? 
}
The function here is not complicated at all: This is the distance $(x,y)$ from the origin, meaning the graph of $f$ is a cone. If we take cross section slices of positive heights, we will get circles. For negative heights, we get an empty set. For $c=0$, $L_c$ only contains the origin.

We can compress these level sets back to 2 dimensions.

\end{figure}

Let us see how our flatlander friend Frankie (apparently that is what the inhabitants of $\reals^2$ call themselves) can visualize this cone from the 2D level sets. Frankie holds a meter that constantly evaluates $f(x,y)$ at any point. He realizes that if he circles the origin at a radius of $r$, the meter will stay constant at a value of $r$. If he walks directly away from the origin, the meter will increase in value. Moreover, because the level sets $L_1,L_2,L_3,L_4,...$ are evenly spaced, Frankie only needs to walk a the same distance away from the origin to raise the meter value the same amount. Translated back to 3D, Frankie is actually `hiking' up the cone as he walks away from the origin. The slope (evaluated from the radial cross section) is $1$, so Frankie walks $k$ units away from the origin to raise his elevation by $k$, no matter where he is.

\example{
    What are the level sets of the function $f(x,y,z)={x^2+y^2+z^2}$? 
} \begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.5\textwidth}
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \filldraw(0,0) circle(1pt);
        \draw (0,0)circle (0.707);
        \draw (0,0)circle (1);
        \draw (0,0)circle (1.224);
        \draw (0,0)circle (1.414);
        \draw (0,0)circle (1.58);
        \draw (0,0)circle (1.73);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Take the 2D analog $g(x,y)=x^2+y^2$. The level sets of $c=0,1,2,\ldots$ are not evenly spaced.}
\end{wrapfigure}
Now we play the role of Frankie. 

First we try to see what the level sets $f(x,y,z)=c$ look like. This is a sphere of radius $\sqrt(c)$. The level sets are also spheres, but this time they are spaced a little bit different. To go from the level set $L_c$ to $L_{c+1}$, we go from the sphere of radius $\sqrt{c}$ to $\sqrt{c+1}$, and the shortest distance is  \begin{align*}
    \sqrt{c+1}-\sqrt{c}&=  \frac{(\sqrt{c+1}-\sqrt{c})(\sqrt{c+1}+\sqrt{c})}{(\sqrt{c+1}+\sqrt{c})}\\ &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{c+1}+\sqrt{c}}
\end{align*}

which gets smaller as $c$ increases! This means we need to walk a shorter distance to increase our meter. Equivalently, the `slope' in this direction increases as we get further away.

We could also hold $z$ constant at $0$ to take one more cross section $(x,y,0,c)$ in $x,y$. The `level sets' of the function $g(x,y)=f(x,y,0)$ look as follows:



\example{Sketch the function $f(x,y)=xy$, either in 3D or through its 2D level sets.}

Let us begin by considering the level sets $xy=c$. This describes the graph $y=c/x$, except for the case $c=0$, then the level set is the x and y axes.

        %\caption{The surface $f(x,y)=xy$}
    \end{subfigure}
\end{figure}


 There are many ways to visualize the actual surface from here: My goto way is to vary $c$ and see how the level set changes. In this case, starting from positive $c$ and decreasing, the curves get closer and closer to the $x$ and $y$ axis, and they `flip' across the axis as the sign of $c$ changes from positive to negative.

The graph looks something like a saddle, or a pringle chip. Saddle points are somewhere between a local maximum and a local minimum. The saddle point of this function is at the origin: going the direction of $x=y$, you will get $f(x,y)=x^2$ that curves upwards; going in the direction of $x=-y$, you get $f(x,y)=-x^2$ which curves downwards. This point is \textit{in some sense} a local minimum and a local maximum depending on which way you look at it.

Indeed, we can rewrite \begin{align*}
    xy = \frac{1}{2}\left[\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x+y)\right)^2 - \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x-y)\right)^2\right],
\end{align*}
so we can rotate our basis vectors $\vec{e}_1,\vec{e}_2\in \reals^2$ to get $(\vec{e}_1-\vec{e}_2)/\sqrt{2},(\vec{e}_1+\vec{e}_2)/\sqrt{2}$. In this new basis, we can plot the rotated saddle as $(y^2 -x^2)/2$.

    \frac{x^2-2kx}{a^2}+\frac{y^2-2my}{b^2}+\frac{z^2-2lz}{c^2}=1
\]
look like?
}
Let us approach a simplier version of the problem first: what is the surface described by \[
    \frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}+\frac{z^2}{c^2}=1?
\]
We know what happens when $a=b=c=1$. Namely, we get the unit sphere. Now if we stretch the x axis by a factor of $a$, we will change from a surface \[
    x^2+y^2+z^2=1 \to \frac{x^2}{a^2}+y^2+z^2=1!
\]
Because the x,y,z axes are orthgonal, we can also stretch the y and z axes by a factor $b$ and $c$ respectively to give the surface. This will give us an ellipsoid, which is just a stretched (or compressed) sphere. To deal with the original equation, we can complete the square to get \begin{align*}
    \frac{x^2-kx}{a^2}+\frac{y^2-my}{b^2}+\frac{z^2-lz}{c^2}&=  \frac{(x-k)^2-k^2}{a^2}+\frac{(y-m)^2-m^2}{b^2}+\frac{(z-l)^2-l^2}{c^2}\\
    &=\frac{(x-k)^2}{a^2}+\frac{(y-m)^2}{b^2}+\frac{(z-l)^2}{c^2} -\frac{k^2}{a^2}-\frac{m^2}{b^2}-\frac{l^2}{c^2}, \\
\end{align*}
Which means we have an ellipsoid but now translated $(k,m,l)$ units!
In the later exercises, you will classify the surfaces described by \[
    x^2+y^2-z^2=1, \ x^2-y^2-z^2=1,
\]
which are called one and two sheeted hyperboloids respectively.

\section{Topology of $\reals^n$}
\begin{remark}[Author's notes]
    This part is slightly touched on in Even's textbook (but scattered across the differentiation chapter). Some past 281 instructors such as John Enns dedicate half a week on topology.  
\end{remark}
\definition{Open Ball}{
    Let $\vec{x}_0\in\reals^n,r>0$. We write the \textbf{open ball of radius $r$ centered at $a$} as $B(\vec{x}_0,r)$, and is the set of all points within $r$ distance away from $a$, i.e. \[
    B(\vec{x}_0,r)\defeq \{x\in\reals^n \ | \ |\vec{x}-\vec{x}_o|<r\}.
    \]
}
    Many statements that we will work towards are `local', in the sense that they only dependent on the behavior of a function in a small open ball centered at a point. For instance, if a function $f:\reals\to\reals$ is continuous at $x=0$, altering the value of the function at any $y\neq 0$ will not change the continuity of the function at $x=0$. This is because the function remains unchanged in the small open ball $B(0,|y|/2)$. Similar, the differentiability (and its derivative) also only depends on the local behavior of the function.

    Thus, we define a set with a special property that each point in the set is `fully contained' inside the set.

\definition{Open sets}{
    Let $\Omega\subseteq \reals^n$.
    We say that $\Omega$ is \textbf{open} if for every $\vec{x}\in\Omega$, there is some radius $r_{\vec{x}}>0$ 
such that $B(\vec{x},r_{\vec{x}})\subseteq\Omega$.}
\begin{remark}
    We want to deal with open sets when we talk about the local behavior of a function. It is not useful to talk about the continuity of a function that is only defined on the integers, this set is not open because every ball centered at an integer will contain a non-integer.
\end{remark}
\proposition{An open ball is open.}
Yeah, this needs a proof.
To show this is open, let $\vec{x} \in B(\vec{x}_0,r)$. Our goal is construct a value $r_{\vec{x}}>0$ such that $B(\vec{x},r_{\vec{x}})\subseteq B(\vec{x}_0,r)$.

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.6\textwidth}
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \node [label=right:{$\vec{x}_0$}] at(0,0) {\textbullet} ;
        \draw [dotted] (0,0) circle (3);
        \draw (0,0)--(-3,0) node [midway, below] {$r$}; 
        \node [label=right:{$\vec{x}$}]at (1.5,1.5) {\textbullet};
        \draw [dotted,red,thick] (1.5,1.5) circle (0.879);
        \draw [thick, red] (1.5,1.5)--(0.878,2.1215) node [midway, left] {$r_{\vec{x}}$}; 
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{wrapfigure}
As long as the distance between $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{x}_0$ is strictly less than $r$, the points within a small vicinity of $\vec{x}$ all have distance $<r$ to $\vec{x}_0$.

This can be made rigorous using the Triangle Inequality.
\begin{proof}
    Let $\vec{x} \in B(\vec{x}_0,r)$. Let $r_{\vec{x}}= r-|\vec{x}_0-\vec{x}|$. Then for any $\vec{y}\in B(\vec{x},r_{\vec{x}})$, we have\begin{align*}
        |\vec{y}-\vec{x}_0|&= |\vec{y}-\vec{x}+\vec{x}-\vec{x}_0|\\ &\leq |\vec{y}-\vec{x}|+|\vec{x}-\vec{x}_0| \\& < r-|\vec{x}_0-\vec{x}|+|\vec{x}_0-\vec{x}|\\& =r,
    \end{align*}
   
    so $\vec{y}\in B(\vec{x}_0,r)\implies B(\vec{x},r_{\vec{x}})\subseteq B(\vec{x}_0,r)$.
\end{proof} \ \\

    The following sets are not open:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The set contianing just one point $\{\vec{x}\}$. Sketch: every ball centered at $\vec{x}$ contains points outside of $\vec{x}$.
        \item The set of points $\{\vec{x}\in \reals^n \ | \ |\vec{x}|\leq r\}$. Sketch: Any ball of radius $\epsilon>0$ centered around the point $(r,0,0,\ldots, 0)$ contains $(r+\epsilon,0,0,\ldots,0)$.
    \end{enumerate}
}
We see that a set fails to be open if there is a point in the boundary of the set. I.e. no matter how small $\epsilon>0$ is, $B(\vec{x},\epsilon)$ extends beyond that set.
\definition{Boundary}{
    Let $\Omega\subseteq\reals^n$. We denote the \textbf{boundary} of $\Omega$ as $\partial \Omega$. This is the set of points in $\vec{x}\in\reals^n$ such that every open ball around $\vec{x}$ contains a point in $\Omega$ and a point not in $\Omega$.
}
Colloquially, $\vec{x}$ is very (arbitrarily) close to $\Omega$, but is also very (arbitrarily) close to $\Omega^c$. So it is on the boundary of the two sets.

\example{
    In $\reals^3$, $\partial B(\vec{0},r)$ is the sphere of radius $r$. Note that a sphere refers to only the surface while a ball consists of the whole interior.
}
\definition{Closure of a set and Closed sets}{
    Let $\Omega\subseteq\reals^n$. We denote the \textbf{closure of $\Omega$} as $\bar{\Omega}\defeq \Omega\cup \partial\Omega$. If $\bar{\Omega}=\Omega$, we say $\Omega$ is \textbf{closed}. Equivalently, a set is closed if it contains its boundary.
}
\proposition{The closure of a set is closed.}
What this means is that if we add in the boundary of a set, we do not create new `boundaries'.
\begin{proof}
    Let $\Omega\subseteq \reals^n$. Let $\vec{x}\in \partial \bar{\Omega}$. Consider open ball of radius $\epsilon>0$ centered around $\vec{x}$. We want to show that this ball contains a point in $\Omega$ and a point in $\partial \Omega$, thus $\vec{x}\in\partial \Omega$ so is already included in $\bar{\Omega}$. 
    
    This ball, by the definition of boundary of $\bar{\Omega}$, contains a point $\vec{a}\in\bar{\Omega}$ and a point in $\vec{b}\in\bar{\Omega}^c$. We first consider $\vec{b}$. Because $\vec{b}\in\bar{\Omega}^c\subseteq (\Omega \cup \partial\Omega)^c = \Omega^c \cap (\partial\Omega)^c\subseteq \Omega^c$. This point is in $\Omega^c$ too.
    If $\vec{a}\in \Omega$, we are done. Else, $\vec{a}\in\partial \Omega$. As $B(\vec{x},\epsilon)$ is open, we can find some open ball $B(\vec{a},\delta)\subseteq B(\vec{x},\epsilon)$. Now we can reapply the definition for $\vec{a}\in\partial \Omega$ to get that there is some point $\vec{a}'\in B(\vec{a},\delta)$ that is in $\Omega$. So we have some $\vec{a}'\in B(\vec{x},\epsilon)$ that is contained in $\Omega$.

    Since $\epsilon$ was arbitrary, we can conlude that every open ball centered around $\vec{x}$ contains a point in $\Omega$ and $\Omega^c$. So $\vec{x}\in\partial \Omega\subseteq \bar{\Omega}$.
\end{proof}
\begin{aproposition}{Sets are not doors}{notdoor}
    Sets are not doors. A set can be both open and closed, or neither.
\end{aproposition}
\begin{proof}
    The empty set is both open and closed. In $\reals^n$, $\reals^n$ is both open and closed.
    The set $1<|x|\leq 2$ is neither open nor closed in $\reals$, as it only contains part of its boundary.

\section{Limits and Continuity}
\definition{Limit Point}{
    Let $\Omega\subseteq\reals^n$. A \textbf{limit point of $\Omega$} is a point $\vec{x}\in\reals^n$ such that every open ball centered around $\vec{x}$ contains a point $\vec{y}\in\Omega$ with $\vec{y}\neq \vec{x}$. Alternatively, using the notation of punctured balls $B^*(\vec{x},r)\defeq B(\vec{x},r)-\{\vec{x}\}$, the intersection \[
        B^*(\vec{x},r)\cap\Omega
    \] is non-empty for every $r>0$.
}
Colloquially, you can approach (get closer and closer to) a limit point by using only points in $\Omega$.
\begin{remark}
    When we talk about limits, we care about the behavior around some point $\vec{x}$ but not at the point $\vec{x}$ (For all we care about, $\vec{x}$ could be outside the domain of the function). This is why the condition $\vec{y}\neq\vec{x}$ is in the definition of a limit point.
\end{remark}
\definition{Limit}{
    \domain{f}{n}{m}. Let $\vec{a}$ be a limit point of $\Omega$, $\vec{b}\in\reals^m$. We denote \textbf{the limit of $f(\vec{x})$ as $\vec{x}$ tends to $\vec{a}$} as $\lim_{\vec{x}\to\vec{a}}$, and say that this limit equals $\vec{b}$ if for all $\epsilon>0$, there is $\delta>0$ such that \[
    |f(\vec{x})-\vec{b}|<\epsilon \textrm{ if } \vec{x}\in B^*(\vec{x},\delta)\cap \Omega,
    \]
    or equivalently, \[
        |f(\vec{x})-\vec{b}|<\epsilon \textrm{ if } 0<|\vec{x}-\vec{a}|<\delta
    \]
    where $f$ is defined.
}
\subsubsection*{Parsing the $\epsilon-\delta$ definition of limit}
For an illustration. Let $\Omega=\reals^2$ and $f:\reals^2\to\reals^2$. We want to consider the limit \[
\lim_{\vec{x}\to\vec{0}}f(\vec{x})=\vec{b}.
\]
We draw the function as taking in values from the input space $\reals^2$ and spitting them them out in the output space $\reals^2$.  
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \node (A) [label=left:{$\vec{x}_1$}]at(-.2,-1) {\textbullet};
            \node (ori) [label=left:{$\vec{0}$}]at(0,0) {\textbullet};
            \node(C) [label=left:{$\vec{x}_2$}] at (0.5,0.5) {\textbullet};
            \node(D)[label=right:{$f(\vec{x}_2)$}]
            at (4.3,1.2) {\textbullet};
            \draw[->](C) edge[bend left =20] (D);
        \node (B) [label=right:{$f(\vec{x}_1)$}]at (5,0) {\textbullet};
    \draw[->] (A) edge [bend right=20]  node[midway, below]{$f$} (B);
    \draw [dotted] (ori) circle (1.5);
    \draw (0,0)--(1.3,-0.75) node[midway, above]{$\delta$}; 
    \node (lim) [label=right:{$\vec{b}$}] at (5.2,0.7){\textbullet};
        \draw [dotted](lim) circle (1.2);
        \draw (5.2,0.7) -- (4,0.7) node[midway, below] {$\epsilon$};
        
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

We do not know what the value $f(\vec{0})$ is - it may not exist. However, we can see if the surrounding values of $f$ approaches some value. To make this rigorous, let's say we want to get within $\epsilon$ distance of the value $\vec{b}$. This corresponds to the open ball on the right. Now we want to pick $\delta$ such that at a very short distance $\delta$ away from $\vec{0}$, the image of $B^*(\vec{0},\delta)$ lands within $B(\vec{b},\epsilon)$. This corresponds to the left open ball.

That means, you can get as close as you like to $\vec{b}$ as long as you are close to $\vec{0}$. If the $\epsilon$ requirement for closeness changes from $0.1$ to $0.0000001$, you can just pick a smaller $\delta$ to get within this distance. Remember: the order of the limit is someone first challenges that you need to get close to the limit in the output space ($\epsilon$), then you pick the ball around the input space ($\delta$) that satisfies that particular value of $\epsilon$.

\proposition{
    Suppose $\lim_{\vec{x}\to\vec{a}}f(\vec{x})$ exists, then it must be unique.
}
The idea is this: suppose you can get arbitrarily close to $\vec{b}$ and arbitrarily close to $\vec{b}'$. Then $\vec{b}$ and $\vec{b}'$ must also be arbitrarily close. But when you have two values that are arbitrarily close, then they must be the same value!
\begin{proof}
    Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, we have the two limits $\vec{b}\neq\vec{b}'$ of $f$ as $\vec{x}\to\vec{a}$. Let $\epsilon=|\vec{b}-\vec{b}'|$. Pick $\delta_1,\delta_2$ such that $|f(\vec{x})-\vec{b}|<\epsilon$ and $|f(\vec{x}-\vec{b}'|<\epsilon|$ when $0<|\vec{x}-\vec{a}|<\delta_1$ and $0<|\vec{x}-\vec{a}|<\delta_2$ respectively. Then pick some $\vec{x}$ such that $0<|\vec{x}-\vec{a}|<\min(\delta_1,\delta_2)$. For this particular value of $\vec{x}$,\[
        \epsilon=|\vec{b}'-\vec{b}|= |\vec{b}'-f(\vec{x})+f(\vec{x})-\vec{b}|\leq|\vec{b}'-f(\vec{x})|+|\vec{b}-f(\vec{x})| <\frac{\epsilon}{2}+\frac{\epsilon}{2}=\epsilon.
    \]
    This gives us the strict inequality $\epsilon<\epsilon$, which is impossible.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
    A consequence of this is that if a limit exists, the limit will be the same using any path of approach. Caution: It is not enough to check a few paths to confirm a limit exists. Take the function \[
        f(x,y)=\begin{cases}
            1 &\textrm { if } x=0\\
            0 &\textrm{otherwise }
        \end{cases}
    \]
    Approaching $f(0,0)$ along any straight line $y=cx$ will give a limit of $0$. However, the limit does not exist, as approaching on the y-axis $x=0$ will give a limit of $1$. 
\end{remark}
\example{
    Compute the limit (if it exists) of \[
    \lim_{(x,y)\to (0,0)} \frac{xy}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}
    \]
}
Let's assume that this limit exists, what must it be? We can test the limit along the x-axis and y-axis. I.e. We set $x$ or $y=0$ and let the the other variable approach $0$. If the limit exists, the limit should be the same no matter how which axis we approach the limit by. Then we see \begin{align*}
    (x=0) \lim_{y\to 0}\frac{0y}{\sqrt{0+y^2}}& =0 \\
    (y=0)\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{0x}{\sqrt{x^2+0}}&=0
\end{align*}
So the limit, if it exists, must be $0$.
Can we show that this exists? Let $\epsilon>0$, then $\delta=[\textrm{placeholder}]$. We want \begin{align*}
    \left|\frac{xy}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}-0\right|<\epsilon
\end{align*} whenever $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}<\delta$. Intuitively, this should be true as the degree of the numerator is $2$ and the degree of the denominator is `$1$'. So the numerator shrinks to $0$ much faster than the denominator. To make this rigorous, we can use the inequality $|x|=\sqrt{x^2}\leq \sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ and similarly, $|y|\leq \sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ to get \[
    \left|\frac{xy}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}-0\right|\leq\left|\frac{x^2+y^2}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\right|
    =\left|\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\right|<\delta.
\]
So setting $\delta=\epsilon$ works! Now we just replace the placeholder with $\epsilon$ and pretend we knew this all along.
\begin{proof}
    We claim the limit is $0$. Let $\epsilon>0$, then for all $|(x,y)|<\epsilon$, we have  \[
        \left|\frac{xy}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}-0\right|\leq\left|\frac{x^2+y^2}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\right|
        =\left|\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\right|<\epsilon.
    \]
\end{proof}
\example{
    Compute the limit (if it exists) of \[
    \lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)} \frac{2x^2+y^2}{x^2+y^2}.
    \]
}
Again, we test a few paths to approach this limit to see what it can be.
Approaching from the y-axis $x=0$, we get \[
\lim_{y=0}\frac{y^2}{y^2}=\lim_{y=0}1 =1.
\]
But if we approach from the x-axis $y=0$, we will get\[
    \lim_{x=0}\frac{2x^2}{x^2}=\lim_{x=0}2 =2.
\]
These two limits are not equal, so we can conclude that the limit does not exist.

\example{
    Compute the limit (if it exists) of \[
        \lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)} \frac{x^2y}{x^4+y^2}.
    \]
}
This is a tricky example. The limits along the $x$ and $y$ axes are both zero.
In fact, the limit along every line passing the origin $y=mx$ is zero, as \begin{align*}
    \lim_{x\to 0}\frac{x^2 (mx)}{x^4+(mx)^2} =  \lim_{x\to 0}\frac{mx}{x^2+m}= 0
\end{align*}
for any $m$. 
However, if we take the limit along the path $y=x^2$, we get \begin{align*}
    \lim_{x\to 0}\frac{x^4 }{x^4+x^4} = \frac{1}{2}.
\end{align*}
The limit does not exist! 


To complete our discussion of limits, the limits in higher dimensions satisfy similar properties as the 1-D limits you know and love from Calculus.
\proposition{
    Let $\Omega\in\reals^n,\vec{x}_0\in\Omega$ and $f,g:\Omega\to\reals^m,c:\Omega\to\reals$. Suppose that the limits $\lim_{\vec{x}\to\vec{x}_0}f(\vec{x})$,  $\lim_{\vec{x}\to\vec{x}_0}g(\vec{x})$ exists, then the following are true:\begin{enumerate}
        \item $\lim_{\vec{x}\to\vec{x}_0}f(\vec{x})+g(\vec{x})=\lim_{\vec{x}\to\vec{x}_0}f(\vec{x})+\lim_{\vec{x}\to\vec{x}_0}g(\vec{x})$
        \item $\lim_{\vec{x}\to\vec{x}_0}f(\vec{x})-g(\vec{x})=\lim_{\vec{x}\to\vec{x}_0}f(\vec{x})-\lim_{\vec{x}\to\vec{x}_0}g(\vec{x})$
        \item $\lim_{\vec{x}\to\vec{x}_0}c(\vec{x})f(\vec{x}) = \lim_{\vec{x}\to\vec{x}_0}c(\vec{x})\lim_{\vec{x}\to\vec{x}_0}f(\vec{x})$
        \item $\lim_{\vec{x}\to\vec{x}_0}\frac{f(\vec{x})}{c(\vec{x})} = \frac{\lim_{\vec{x}\to\vec{x}_0}f(\vec{x})}{\lim_{\vec{x}\to\vec{x}_0}c(\vec{x})}$, if the denominator is not zero.
    \end{enumerate}
}
The proof is not enlightening, and just uses a lot of $\epsilon-\delta$ definitions for limits.
\definition{Continuity}{
    \domain{f}{n}{m}. We say that $f$ is \textbf{continuous} at $\vec{x}_0\in\Omega$ if \[
    \lim_{\vec{x}\to\vec{x}_0} f(x) = f(\vec{x}_0).
    \]
}
\begin{remark}
    Another way to look at this is that you can pull the limit into the function \[
        \lim_{\vec{x}\to\vec{x}_0} f(x) = f(\lim_{\vec{x}\to\vec{x}_0}\vec{x})=f(\vec{x}_0).
