\chapter{Span and Linear Independence}

Now that we are practiced with vector spaces, we can begin taking linear combinations of vectors in an arbitrary vector space.

\definition{Span} {
    For some finite set of vectors $\{v_1, v_2, ... , v_k\}$ in a vector space $V$, the \textit{span} of that set is the set of 
    all linear combinations of the vectors in the set: \newline 
    \[span\{v_1, v_2, ... , v_k\} = \{c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + ... + c_kv_k | c_1, c_2, ... c_k \in \mathbb{R}\}\]
}

Remark: note that the span of an empty set is technically the zero vector: $span\{\empty\} = \{0_V\}$.

\proposition{\textit{The span of any set of vectors in $V$ is always a subspace of $V$}}

\textit{Proof.} The span of a set of vectors includes all linear combinations of them, so taking two linear combinations and 
making more combinations of them will still live in the span. In other words, the span is by definition closed under scalar
multiplication and vector addition.

It can be difficult to how to think about what the span of a set of vectors looks like, though it is also important to develop
an intuition for it as more complex techniques are developed. It is also important to consider what vectors span a given subspace.

\example{For example, the vector space of $\mathbb{R}^3$ is spanned by the set of unit vectors $\{i, j, k\}$.}

Vector spaces' sizes can be compared by the minimum number of vectors required to span them. This "dimensionality" will be used more
later, but for now it is important that vector spaces can be either finite or infinite dimensional.

\example{Vector spaces like $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be spanned by $n$ vectors and thus are finite dimensional. Vector
spaces that are composed of less linear objects, like the set of all functions $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, are often
infinite dimensional. In this case, note that there's no finite list of functions such that all other functions from $\mathbb{R}
\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are linear combinations of them.}
