\chapter{Span and Linear Independence}

Now that we are practiced with vector spaces, we can begin taking linear combinations of vectors in an arbitrary vector space.

\definition{Span} {
    For some finite set of vectors $\{v_1, v_2, ... , v_k\}$ in a vector space $V$, the \textit{span} of that set is the set of 
    all linear combinations of the vectors in the set: \newline 
    \[span\{v_1, v_2, ... , v_k\} = \{c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + ... + c_kv_k | c_1, c_2, ... c_k \in \mathbb{R}\}\]
